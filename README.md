This is my project for school. You can use the Filter option to choose what you want to be shown or you can leave it empty and everything will show. You can add a game through the add a game button. The new game must have a name, genre and price (The only allowed genres that will not break the program are 
Action, Fighting, MMO, Puzzle, Racing, RogueLike, RPG, Sandbox, Shooter and Soulslike)
